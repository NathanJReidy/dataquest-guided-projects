    "Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.\n",

    "At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",

    "Collecting data for over four million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we'll try to analyze a sample of data instead. To avoid spending resources with collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see whether we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our purpose:\n",

    "- A data set containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play. You can download the data set directly from this link.\n",

    "However, this niche seems to show some potential. One thing we could do is take another popular book and turn it into an app where we could add different features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes about the book, etc. On top of that, we could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users don't need to exit our app to look up words in an external app.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea seems to fit well with the fact that the App Store is dominated by for-fun apps. This suggests the market might be a bit saturated with for-fun apps, which means a practical app might have more of a chance to stand out among the huge number of apps on the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other genres that seem popular include weather, book, food and drink, or finance. The book genre seem to overlap a bit with the app idea we described above, but the other genres don't seem too interesting to us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weather apps — people generally don't spend too much time in-app, and the chances of making profit from in-app adds are low. Also, getting reliable live weather data may require us to connect our apps to non-free APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Food and drink — examples here include Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, etc. So making a popular food and drink app requires actual cooking and a delivery service, which is outside the scope of our company.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finance apps — these apps involve banking, paying bills, money transfer, etc. Building a finance app requires domain knowledge, and we don't want to hire a finance expert just to build an app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's analyse the Google Play market a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Most Popular Apps by Genre on Google Play\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Google Play market, we actually have data about the number of installs, so we should be able to get a clearer picture about genre popularity. However, the install numbers don't seem precise enough — most values are open-ended (100+, 1,000+, 5,000+, etc.). Nevertheless, we're going to leave the numbers as they are (we don't have any better data to work with), which means that we'll consider that an app with 100,000+ installs has 100,000 installs, and an app with 1,000,000+ installs has 1,000,000 installs, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform computations, however, we'll need to convert each install number to float — this means that we need to remove the commas and the plus characters, otherwise the conversion will fail and raise an error. We'll do this directly in the loop below, where we also compute the average number of installs for each genre (category)."
